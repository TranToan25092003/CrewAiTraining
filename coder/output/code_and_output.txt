# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the total by 4

total = 0
for i in range(10000):
    term = (-1) ** i / (2 * i + 1)  # calculating the i-th term
    total += term  # summing the terms

result = total * 4  # multiplying the total by 4

# Output the result
print(result)

# Output of the code
